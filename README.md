Coupon Purchase Prediction using Machine Learning
 Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a customer will purchase a coupon based on various demographic, behavioral, and contextual factors. The dataset contains features such as weather, time, passenger type, and restaurant visit history. We apply machine learning techniques to build and evaluate classification models.
Project Workflow
Data Collection,Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and normalized numerical data ,
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified feature distributions, outliers,  and correlations.
Model Selection & Training: Tested multiple classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, and SVM.
Model Evaluation: Compared models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
